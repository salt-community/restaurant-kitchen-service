# 👨‍🍳🍳 restaurant-kitchen-service 🍲👨‍🍳
## Introduction
As part of a two-week upskill project in Apache Kafka we have created a restaurant kitchen service.

This is one of 4 microservices that together form a restaurant application. See the other ones here:

- [Order Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-order-service)
- [Payment Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-payment-service)
- [Delivery Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-delivery-service)
- [Kitchen Service](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-kitchen-service) <- you are here

Additionally, we have a [frontend](https://github.com/salt-community/restaurant-frontend-simulation) to visualize the backend flow.
